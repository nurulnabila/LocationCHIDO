    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=5D:59:23:27:43:1B:61:4E:B3:B5:E8:F2:47:37:A0:93:0E:E0:79:95%3Bcom.makotogo.mobile.datetimepickerexample

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    5D:59:23:27:43:1B:61:4E:B3:B5:E8:F2:47:37:A0:93:0E:E0:79:95

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    5D:59:23:27:43:1B:61:4E:B3:B5:E8:F2:47:37:A0:93:0E:E0:79:95

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
